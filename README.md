Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
- The Gaming Room is client that requested a web-based software replicating their current Android-app game. The game requires more than one team and multiple players per team. Each team needs a unique name and only one instance of the game should exist. The software requires access to a large library of images. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
- I documented exactly what the clients requested. All the information to start developing the application can be accessed in this document. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
- At any point if I had a question, I could reference this document and it would provide more information. The document is organized and labeled in a way that the information can be easily located. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
- I would revise the evaluation section. While this section has a lot of useful information, I feel it could be better organized and clearer. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
- I put a lot of focus on what is required to develop a website. There are several website requirements that are not necessarily thought about from a non-technical perspective. It is important to get the initial setup running to build on the front-end designing. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
- First, I started with an outline of what is needed by the customer, then I outlined what is required by creating a website. Next, a UML Diagram was created to prep for the coding. In the future I will definitely create a UML, as it outlines the code and provides a backbone for other developers easily understand how the code is organized.
